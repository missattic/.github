The **Missattic exETL Framework** is a Java framework to build data pipelines.


It has been designed and build by [VOPEN.XYZ. Palmer.Xu](https://github.com/misselvexu) at [Origin Base Pipeline Project](https://github.com/misselvexu/mixmicro-pipeline) as a lightweight data transformation framework for their ventures. Today the Missattic Packages are maintained and developed further by the missattic Open Source community.
